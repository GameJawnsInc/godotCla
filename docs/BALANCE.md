# Balance targets and measurements

Reference numbers for TENDER's difficulty, and the discipline for changing them.

## Method

- 30-seed playtests (`tests/playtest.gd`) are smoke tests: good for "did this
  break the game," too noisy for tuning calls (±8 wins swing observed on
  identical builds across seed batches).
- Balance decisions require 100+ seeds. The `tests/sweep_lib.gd` runner makes
  ad-hoc measurement scripts trivial.
- Any sweep outlier gets verified at 30+ seeds before a patch (see the
  thorn_shield false positive: 5/10 in a pair sweep, 11/30 solo vs 10/30
  baseline — flagged, verified, not patched).

## Targets (full 7-floor run, tier 0, base pool)

| persona   | target                  | why |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----|
| optimizer | 30–50% wins             | skilled play should win often but never be safe |
| sprout    | avg depth 3.5–5, wins rare | noobs feel progress; full clears are earned |
| wanderer  | dies floor 1–2, 0 wins  | the world must punish random play |
| all       | zero timeouts/softlocks | every run ends in win or death |

Death-cause shape: optimizer dies mostly to combat, sprout mostly to smog
(greed), and deaths spread across floors rather than piling on one wall.

## Measurements

### 2026-08-08 (upgrades + elites + vaults in)

- optimizer, 100 seeds: **32 wins**, avg floor 5.03,
  deaths by floor {2:13, 3:16, 4:7, 5:15, 6:17} — in band, no wall.
- 30-seed personas: sprout avg floor 4.5 (smog-dominated deaths, bloom ~22),
  wanderer floor-1 deaths, timeouts ≈ 0–1.
- Tier ladder (20 seeds each): 8/7/7/7/5/3 — monotonic, all winnable.
- Packages (20 seeds): baseline 8, +mycology 7, +hydraulics 6, +aeolian 7 —
  mild pool dilution, no dominant ability.

### 2026-08-08 later (content breadth + Overseer + clone in)

- optimizer, 100 seeds: **42 wins**, avg floor 5.25. Both bosses drawn
  (furnace_core 17 arrivals, overseer 25); every floor-7 arrival converted.
- Slams widened to a cross (tile + neighbors) after the arrival-conversion
  finding; optimizer still dodges perfectly, sprout does not (~5/30 floor-7
  deaths). Decision: tier-0 bosses are a skill check that perfect play
  passes; the tier ladder supplies post-win boss pressure.
- 30-seed personas: optimizer 11/30, sprout avg floor 4.5 (smog 24/30),
  wanderer floor 1. Win rate drifting toward the top of the 30-50% band as
  player-power content accumulates - re-measure after each content round.

## Watch list

- `parched` mutator barely affects the optimizer (banking may be undervalued).
- Boss deaths are rare once seed_bomb is protected; arrivals are the real
  filter. If arrival rates rise, re-check Furnace difficulty.
- Elites are tanky bounty-carriers (+2 hp, +0 dmg, +4 bloom). The +1 dmg
  variant measurably overshot (optimizer ~17% at 30 seeds).
